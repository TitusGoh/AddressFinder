About:
Created a address management service that has 10 countries and over 45,000 total unique addresses. The application allows you to search for an address in a country based off keywords in various parts of the address such as the city and name. Additionally, you are able to add a address to the database, which in turn allows you to search for it in the future. Lastly, you can select an address and edit it, cascading the changes into the database as well.
